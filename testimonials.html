			<p class="testimonial">We are delighted with our Billy Cranford built home. He worked with us throughout the mostly custom design process, build, and finishing touches. As customers, we were apprehensive and slightly overwhelmed  with the idea of building  a house. But Billy made the job virtually  stress free (well, almost). We were also impressed with his subs. They had been working with Billy for years, showed up when they were supposed to and delivered a product that was indicative of their experience. And, lastly, we can't say enough about Billy's foreman, Scott Gaddy. A strong work ethic, great sense of humor, and loyalty made working with "Scoot" a delight. Kudos to all!</p>

			<p class="testimonial">We love our new Cranford Home!  We have lived here for just over a year now, and the stand out elements for us are the wonderful design, executed in a high quality, at a fair price!</p>
			<p class="testimonial">Billy Cranford is an experienced builder who is easy to work with and will tailor his designs to fit your individual needs.  Additionally, Billy is dedicated to delivering your home on time making the entire process a pleasure.

			<p class="testimonial">It is easy for me to write a review for Cranford Homes and to highly endorse Billy Cranford.</p>
			<p class="testimonial">As an engineer, and this being the 4th house we have built, we may have been a little more picky than most. The first thing we liked about Billy is that he grew up in the trade doing what he now supervises. He knows what a good house looks like and how it should be built from doing it himself. As we reviewed some houses that he currently had under construction, we quickly saw that he was passionate about quality and making sure a Cranford home is structurally sound.
			</p>
			<p class="testimonial">The 2nd thing that stood out was the fact that his crew has been with him for more than 15 years. With the volatility of the construction industry, that spoke to us about his leadership in how he was able to keep his team together.
			</p>
			<p class="testimonial">The 3rd thing took a little research. We wanted to make sure Billy was a man of his word. What we heard when we asked, from architect to the companies Cranford Homes purchases their building supplies from was all the same; Billy Cranford's integrity was the highest of anyone they dealt with. Not only does he pay his bills on time, he does what he says he is going to do. When we contracted Billy to build our house, we experienced the same. Billy was a joy to work with and we consider him a friend.
			</p>
			<p class="testimonial"> Cranford Homes built our house 3 1/2 years ago. If we were to build again, we would do everything in our power to contract with Billy Cranford to build our house all over again.

			<p class="testimonial">We were incredibly pleased with the renovations completed by Cranford Homes! Every step of the process was accomplished in a professional and timely manner. The finished work was beautiful and far exceeded our expectations! We would highly recommend Billy Cranford for any size project!</p>
